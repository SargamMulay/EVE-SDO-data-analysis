# EVE-SDO-data-analysis

The Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) instrument is onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) observatory.

Since 2010, EVE has been observing the Sun and produce a spectrum in the wavelength range of 0.1 to 105 nm. It provides data with a time resolution of 10 seconds in "Sun as a star" mode and does not offer image resolution.

The EVE instrument employs two grating spectrographs: MEGS-A for short wavelengths (5-37 nm) and MEGS-B for longer wavelengths (35-105 nm). Each spectrograph images the wavelength-dispersed whole solar disk onto a CCD.

This tutorial includes information on ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of solar flares and provides guidance on how to analyze flare data using Python programming.
